\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

As the analysis showed, there is a variety of applications suited for tracking long-term goals or repetitive activities.
Only TickTick proved to be suitable for both.
However, it has shortfalls as well.

Social engagement was efficiently utilized in Habitify and Habitica
but those applications lack the ability to track anything except for habits.

In conclusion, there is an evident gap that could be filled with a new application that will take social engagement even further and provide
features for tracking long-term goals and repetitive activities.
