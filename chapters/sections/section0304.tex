\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

As the research showed, there is a variety of applications suited for tracking of long-term or repetitive activities.
Only TickTick proved to be suited for both, but not without its drawbacks.

Social engagement was efficiently utilized in Habitify and Habitica,
but those applications lack ability to track anything other than habits.

In conclusion, there is a visible gap that could be filled with even more social application that will provide
features for long-term and repetitive activities tracking.
