\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

As the research showed, there is a variety of applications suited for tracking long-term goals or repetitive activities.
Only TickTick proved to be suited for both, but not without a flaw.

Social engagement was efficiently utilized in Habitify and Habitica,
but those applications lack ability to track anything other than habits.

In conclusion, there is a visible gap that could be filled with an application that will take social engagement even further and provide
features for tracking long-term goals and repetitive activities.
