\section{Development testing}\label{sec:dev-testing}

The purpose of development testing is to verify expected behavior and ensure that changes to the application will not break existing functionality.

Development testing included unit testing, integration testing and ad-hoc web client testing.
For server testing in-memory H2 database was used.
This ensured data consistency every test run.
Unit tests covered Service components functionality to verify expected behavior.

Integration testing was done using Postman which is an application for REST API testing.
This application allows joining multiple requests to test scenarios.
Benefit of this approach is that the server first can be tested locally and then again after the deployment in production.
