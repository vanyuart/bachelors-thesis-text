\section{Technological stack}\label{sec:technological-stack}

Technological stack was considered with developer experience and free of use in mind.
Popularity, community and performance were also taken into account.

\subsection{Server side}\label{subsec:ts-server-side}

Kotlin with Spring framework was selected as server side language and PostreSQL as database.\cite{kotlin, spring, postgresql}
Kotlin is a modern programming language that compiles to Java.
Compilation to Java allows to use any Java library while using Kotlin.
There are many reasons to use Kotlin over Java.
One of them is the null safety.
Another is the strong influence of functional programming, which brings convenient features such as scope functions, high order functions and lambda expressions.
Since Kotlin compiles into Java it provides same performance while significantly reduces boilerplate code.
Consider following snippet written in Java.\\

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    public Person(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
\end{Verbatim}

Kotlin equivalent for that snipped would be following.\\
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
class Person(var firstName: String, var lastName: String)
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Frontend}\label{subsec:ts-frontend}

React was selected as frontend framework with Material-UI as a design library.\cite{react, material}
React positions itself as a UI library, which means further libraries such as Axios (client-server communication) and Redux (state management) might be needed.\cite{axios, redux}
