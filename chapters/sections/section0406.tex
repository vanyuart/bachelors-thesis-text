\section{Wireframes}\label{sec:wireframes}

Wireframes serve as a schematic representation of the user interface.
The main target is to display what functions will be available on which pages.
Wireframes are not intended to represent the looks of the future application.
Implemented user interface is slightly different as it has to be mobile friendly.
The example of a wireframe and several application's screens is located in the Appendix ~\ref{ch:app-wireframe-screens}.
