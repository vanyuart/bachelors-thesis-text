\section{Data collection}\label{sec:data-collection}

Data collection was done using Google search engine.
The first step was to find applications using following keywords: "personal development apps", "habit tracker", "self-improvement apps".
The top five pages for each keyword were used to gain initial dataset.
The next step was to manually filter gathered data.
The first step of filtration was to manually remove duplicates.
The second step was to remove activity specific applications: sport, meditation, brain training.
The third step was to remove applications with static textual content on topics of psychology, personal development and life improvement techniques.
The fourth step was to remove applications aimed exclusively at personal care, skincare, mood journals and sleep journals.
The fifth step was to remove business and productivity applications aimed primarily at small scale time management, short-term goals and daily productivity.
The sixth step was to remove applications aimed strongly at bad habits breaking, such as smoking and drinking.
The seventh step was to remove applications available for single platform exclusively, e.g., iOS\@.
The last step was to remove applications that provide are very similar in terms of interface, user experience and functionality.

Details of dataset filtering process are described in Table 3.1.
The result of filtering is 5 applications that will be analyzed in the next section.
