%Regarding the personal-development competitive attitude (PDCA),
%the primary focus is on personal growth and on the enjoyment and mastery of the task in a competitive situation.
%The goal attainment and competition outcome (i.e., on winning) is important,
%but not at the expense of the derogation of other competitors (Ryckman et al., 1996).

Whereas the previous section created a basis for data management and data flow,
this section will introduce justification for competitiveness as an instrument for personal development.
Social engagement element of the application will be based on this justification.

For a long time, until the 1990s, in psychology competitiveness was considered as a unidimensional scale with cooperation as the opposite ~\cite{the-four-faces-of-competetition}.
Research article named "The Four Faces of Competition" summarized development of recent decades and introduced four-dimensional scale for competitiveness.
