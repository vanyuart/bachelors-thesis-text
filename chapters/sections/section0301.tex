Based on the previous chapter, core features for the application are as follows: personal development planning and social engagement.
The application should be multi-platformed as well.

\textit{Personal development planning} encapsulates the features which the application provides for a structured approach to personal development.
This should handle repetitive activities as well as long-term plans.
Progress tracking and possibility to review old plans are also a part of that criteria.

\textit{Social engagement} criterion includes features that the application provides for interaction between users.
It might be the sharing of goal(s) progression or mutual goals of different users that are pursued simultaneously.

\textit{Multi-platform} is a criterion required by the idea of a shared user experience.
Limited platform availability might be a problem for some groups of users, e.g, Android and iOS\@
Only web, Android and iOS platforms are considered with regard to this project.
Windows, Macintosh and Linux are not going to be considered due to general decrease in popularity of desktop platform.\cite{mobile-vs-desktop}
