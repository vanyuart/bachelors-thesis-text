It might be sharing of goal's progress or mutual goals of different users that they pursue at the same time.

Only web, Android and iOS platforms are considered in terms of this project.
Windows, Macintosh and Linux are not going to be considered due to general decrease of popularity of desktop platform.\cite{mobile-vs-desktop}
