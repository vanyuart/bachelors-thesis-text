\section{Motivation}\label{sec:introduction-motivation}

From elementary school till the final year of university studies, one was able to compare themselves with peers.
In some cases this could be the source of strong motivation that stimulates a continuous process of learning.
In order to keep myself from falling into a daily routine of work when my
studies are over and to be able to continue to actively study, I decided to look
into applications for personal development.

Prompt research demonstrated that applications with social engagement elements tend to be well accepted by users,
but also revealed a shortage of such applications.
Those that compiled with the social engagement criterion lacked crucial functions that could be beneficial for the process of personal development.
Also, only small amount of them used competitiveness as a motivation for personal development.

This paper will shortly examine the domain of personal development, justify that friendly competition might be used as a tool for personal development,
compare existing solutions and provide an analysis for the future application.


\section{Problem description}\label{sec:problem-description}

Personal development is a lifelong process.
As well as many other activities, this process is more effective with a defined, measured approach.
There are many well-built solutions aimed to structure the process of personal development.
These solutions have variety of ways to approach their users, which means that each could find an application that works for them.
The problem with these applications is a small to none amount of social engagement.
Users could rely exclusively on their motivation and discipline in order to use such application effectively and on a long-term basis.

Another type of personal development applications are habit trackers.
These applications aim at development of new desired habits and abandonment of unwanted ones.
Habit trackers often include gamification elements and usually there is a slight social engagement element.
There are also habit trackers that use the idea of friendly competition, which introduces higher level of social engagement.
On the other hand, these applications usually lack a structural approach, visual reports and planning features.

Application that motivates user through interaction with others, capable of activity planning for long-term plans and repetitive habits
will take the best from both application types mentioned above and could provide better user experience.
The problem that this paper is trying to solve and analyse is a proposal of such application.


\section{Solution idea}\label{sec:solution-idea}

In order to use the best parts of previously mentioned application types, two main aspects should be designed thoroughly.
The first is the ability of application to provide an effective way of data input and data management.
The second is the high, but optional, level of social engagement.

The fist objective is going to be achieved by separation of activities on two types - goals and habits.
Goals will provide an interface for input and organization of targets that user would like to pursue.
A goal's progress is going to be measured by tasks completion.
Habits, on the other hand, will provide an interface for repetitive activities that do not require planning.

The second objective is to increase user's motivation through members of theirs social circle.
This is going to be achieved through activity sharing.
Optionality of this feature would be available through visibility setting in goals and habits.
This separation will provide a substantial amount social engagement.

The biggest challenge of the described application is the design of an intuitive and minimalistic user interface.
