{\color{red}//IDEA Friendly competition}

This chapter will introduce the reader to author's motivation, problem's description and the basic idea of the future application.

~\nameref{sec:introduction-motivation} section describes personal point of view of the author.
Detailed analysis of the related domain will be the part of ~\nameref{ch:personal-development-domain} chapter.

~\nameref{sec:problem-description} section describes problems application will attempt to solve and
~\nameref{sec:solution-idea} section will draw basic idea of the application, whereas exact approach
will be introduced in following chapters: ~\nameref{ch:solution-analysis}, ~\nameref{ch:implementation}, ~\nameref{ch:testing}.


\section{Motivation}\label{sec:introduction-motivation}

{\color{gray}//ASK Can I write here from my perspective?}

From an elementary school till the final year of university studies, one was able to compare himself to peers.
This could be the source of strong motivation that stimulates continuous process of learning.
In order to keep myself from falling into daily routine of work when my studies are over,
but instead to continue to actively study, I decided to look into applications for personal development.
Prompt research showed that there is a gap in the market that could be filled.
This paper will shortly examine the domain of personal development, compare existing solutions and provide an analysis for a
new application.
{\color{gray}//ASK Mention implementation here?}

\section{Problem description}\label{sec:problem-description}

Personal development is a life-long process.
As many other activities, this process is more effective with defined, measured approach.
There are many well-build solutions aimed to structure process of personal development.
These solutions have variety of ways to approach their users, which means that each could find an application that works for them.
The problem with these applications is small to none amount of social engagement.
Users should be motivated and disciplined enough by themselves and, in some cases, by application.

Another type of personal development applications are habit trackers.
These applications aimed at development of new desired habits and abandonment of unwanted.
Often those include gamification elements and
As competetiveness drives people

These applications on the other hand have a disa
The problem with applications aimed at process of measured personal development is that the whole process is held entirely



Two major problems in life-long proce
Friendly competition could be a motivator not only for studies, sports and games, but, as further research will show,
also for personal development.


As mentioned in the previous section, the idea is to use

Personal development could be measured in many {\color{blue}//TODO which?} ways.
In terms of this paper we will consider
