\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

The domain research provided an understanding of personal development process.
This understanding allowed proposition of data management.
The second part of the domain research justified that competitiveness might be used as a motivator for personal development.

Analysis of existing solution allowed spotting common pitfalls and gave ideas for features that might improve overall user experience.
This analysis also demonstrated uniqueness of the application idea and therefore proved worth of further analysis and implementation.

Based on the research and analysis of existing solutions, the application analysis was provided.
Research of the domain served as the basis for domain model.
Functional requirements were mostly derived from the analysis of existing solutions.

This paper will serve as a foundation for bachelor's thesis.
Bachelor's thesis will finalize the solution analysis chapter with a UI/UX design in the form of wireframes.
Two more chapters will come in the bachelor's thesis.
The implementation chapter will contain analysis for the selected technologies and notes regarding decision-making during implementation.
The testing chapter will contain notes regarding selected testing methods and testing results.

Current state of the project is the server-side development and the web application configuration.
